<h1>James Sacharanski</h1>
<p><strong>IT & Security · South Jersey · 1 semester away from an M.S. in Cybersecurity (Rowan University)</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I work in IT and security, focusing on endpoint management, user support, access, and
keeping core systems stable. In my current role, I work with tools like CrowdStrike Falcon,
Jira Service Management, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365 to support staff and maintain
a reliable environment.
</p>
<p>
Outside of work, I use controlled test environments to build practical skills such as
system enumeration, misconfiguration analysis, and privilege escalation. My goal is to be
useful on a security-focused team, not just familiar with terminology.
</p>
<p>
I am currently one semester away from completing my M.S. in Cybersecurity at Rowan University
and I am interested in roles that combine IT operations with security work
(security operations, endpoint security, or vulnerability/access management).

<h2>Practice & learning</h2>
<p>
I use test environments to practice:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>System enumeration and service discovery</li>
  <li>Identifying common misconfigurations</li>
  <li>Privilege escalation techniques on Windows and Linux</li>
