        I work in IT and security, focusing on endpoint management, user support, access, 
        and the day-to-day operations that keep systems stable. I use tools like CrowdStrike 
        Falcon, Jira Service Management, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365 to support users 
        and maintain a clean operational baseline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside my job, I use controlled test environments to build practical technical 
        skills—mainly system enumeration, misconfiguration analysis, and privilege 
        escalation. These environments help me understand how systems behave under real 
        conditions and give me a stronger foundation for security work.

        I’m currently one semester away from completing my M.S. in Cybersecurity at Rowan 
        University. I’m interested in roles that mix IT operations, security monitoring, and 
        hands-on analysis, where I can apply what I’ve learned while continuing to grow.
